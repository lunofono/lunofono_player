A Flutter widget to play content bundles for Lunofono.

## Contributing

This project is written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Once you have
a working Flutter SDK installed, you can test it using `flutter test`.

### Git Hooks

This repository provides some useful Git hooks to make sure new commits have
some basic health.

The hooks are provided in the `.githooks/` directory and can be easily used by
configuring git to use this directory for hooks instead of the default
`.git/hooks/`:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

So far there is a hook to prevent commits with the `WIP` word in the message to
be pushed, and one hook to run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` before
a new commit is created. The later can take some time, but it can be easily
disabled temporarily by using `git commit --no-verify` if you are, for example,
just changing the README file or amending a commit message.
